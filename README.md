## Instructions
Ghibli Wars is a role cards turn based game. In this game, you have four cards to chose from, and you must click on one to begin your turn. There are three types of cards: attack, defense and potion.
You begin the game with 100 HP. Attack cards deal the amount of damage shown on the card, while defense cards lessen the amount of damage taken; the applied defense is shown in blue text, and damage taken while defense is active is displayed in purple text to indicate that some of the damage was blocked. Potion cards can either recover or reduce your HP, so choose wisely.
You win when your opponent's life reaches zero.

## Disclaimer
I do not own any art (illustration, gif, music, video, etc) used in the game, I merely did a transformative work, and the idea is not original either, the game is based on the flash game Maganic Wars.
I thank all the artists who posted their art on the internet so that this game could have a soul, otherwise it would be just empty lines of code.
Also, the game is newly made, so expect there to be a bug or two that went unnoticed, I'll do my best to fix them in the future.
I also make it clear that there may be spoilers (~4 second excerpts) from the movies due to the effect of each card.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please send them to me.
